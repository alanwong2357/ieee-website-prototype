	<h2>Jacobis Soriano</h2>
	<h4>VICE PRESIDENT</h4>
	<p>
		I am a senior majoring in Electrical Engineering with a specializing in semiconductors and optoelectronics. Some of my interests are autonomous vehicles, robotics, writing C code & debugging (the best way to learn). I approach engineering with a control systems mindset; execute a process with the desired reference, reassess, correct and re-execute the process.
		This year I aim to enhance membership experience, differentiate IEEE@UCI’s image and create a unique and inclusive club environment. My strengths are in facilitating collaborative efforts and propel students in carrying their visions forward.

	<h2>Nathan Bernardo</h2>
	<h4>INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT</h4>
	<p>
		Hi y’all!  My name is Nathan (some call me Nate Dog), and I am pursuing an Electrical Engineering degree.  I’m a theorist, so I am useless at the moment (just kidding).  I am very interested in Computer Vision, so I spend most of my time learning and practicing Artificial Intelligence (pretty fun if you ask me).   Besides my studious life, I do read books.  One of my favorite books is “WasteLand,” by T.S. Elliot.  I love baking chocolate chip cookies.  A fun fact that I usually tell everyone: I had my own small cookie business in high school.  I am a wholesome boi, but don’t ask me how I’m doing because small talks are boring.

	<h2>Samuel Bondoc</h2>
	<h4>MEDIA COORDINATOR</h4>
	<p>Hi everyone!</p>
	<p>My name is Sam, and I'm an undergraduate in my second year of pursuing a degree in computer engineering (CpE).</p>
	<p>I enjoy coding mostly because I'm lazy and like looking for ways to make things do things for me. Other than that, though, I've been interested in pathfinding, machine vision, and environment generation since my days as an avid Starcraft/Starcraft II content creator.</p>
	<p>Outside of my academic interests, I play violin in the UCI symphony orchestra and am a weekend radio show host at KUCI.</p>
	<p>I'll be the one posting <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IEEE.UCI/">Facebook</a> events and sending you guys <s>spam</s> emails most of the time, so you'll know who messed up if there's a typo or something. (Not me of course.)</p>
